This is a basic Pong game using SVGs.

JavaScript (ES2015) is used to create the SVGs, move the ball, paddles, calculate the players' score, trigger audio during game play, and declare the winner.

## Personal Learnings
* As this was new code for me, writing out the classes at a high level helped me understand how all the classes worked together and allowed me to figure out how to implement my stretch goal and any other changes I chose to make.

* A new set of extensions and packages were used for this project, which helped in resolving syntax errors. I have used GULP in a previous project and now WebPack. Both tools are useful but are configured differently. I see the value of both tools.

* I enjoyed working with SVGs. I was pleasantly surprised how many options I have to creating SVGs and how quickly they load in comparison to an image.

* Creating a game is not an easy task. Even a simple game, such as Pong can be complex. I have a new appreciation for individuals and companies who create games.
